TemplateResponseMixin : This mixin takes charge of rendering templates
and returning an HTTP response. It requires a template_name attribute
that indicates the template to be rendered and provides the render_to_
response() method to pass it a context and render the template.

View : The basic class-based view provided by Django.

get_formset() : You define this method to avoid repeating the code to build
the formset. You create a ModuleFormSet object for the given Course object
with optional data.

dispatch() : This method is provided by the View class. It takes an HTTP
request and its parameters and attempts to delegate to a lowercase method
that matches the HTTP method used. A GET request is delegated to the get()
method and a POST request to post() , respectively. In this method, you use
the get_object_or_404() shortcut function to get the Course object for the
given id parameter that belongs to the current user. You include this code in
the dispatch() method because you need to retrieve the course for both GET
and POST requests. You save it into the course attribute of the view to make
it accessible to other methods.

get() : Executed for GET requests. You build an empty ModuleFormSet
formset and render it to the template together with the current
Course object using the render_to_response() method provided by
TemplateResponseMixin .

post() : Executed for POST requests.
